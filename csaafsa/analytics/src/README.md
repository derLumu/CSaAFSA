# Static Analyser

#### The static analyser holds the following functions:

- Analysing your endpoints
- Analysing your exceptions
- Analysing your datatypes

#### The analysis runs in five steps

1. The datatypes are [extracted](extraction/README.md)
2. The endpoints are [extracted](extraction/README.md)
3. The [datatypes are analysed](analyseDatatype/README.md)
4. The [endpoints and exceptions are analysed](analyseDatatype/README.md)
5. The results are outputed
